🍹 INTRODUCTION-

Hello, my fellow coders and viewers. The time has come after months of studies and practice to present to you my first-ever web application. I'm excited to showcase the new skills and knowledge that I have adapted to create this piece of art. Yes, in the coding world we do in fact consider this a form of art. There have been plenty of highs and lows throughout phase one and I’d like to acknowledge everyone who has helped and pushed me through. Without the support and guidance, I wouldn’t have gotten this far. I have truly gained a love for coding and the many wonders it has to offer. Ok, ok. Enough of the sap! I’d like to introduce to you ‘Ritas new web application… “‘Ritas”.


🍹What is ‘Ritas?

‘Ritas is a well-known bar in the vibrant neighborhood of Hells Kitchen here in the Big Apple. The space is well known for its eclectic margarita selection and never fails to stay busy. It’s a place of sweet escapes for just a moment in time. Had a bad day? Come to ‘Ritas. Can’t stand New York winters and want to feel like you are somewhere tropical?  Come to ‘Ritas. Want to romanticize your first date? Come to ‘Ritas!


🍹What is the goal of the ‘Ritas Web Application?

As mentioned ‘Ritas stays having heavy foot traffic. There are times it's so busy, drinks can take a bit longer than expected. So I thought to myself, what can we do to make sure our customers have a pleasant experience every time they come to ‘Ritas? My first thought was to hire more bartenders. However, the team is solid and there’s no room for new employees. So what else can we do? Ah, got it! Create a web application for customers that don’t want to take the risk of playing the waiting game. They can simply head to the ‘Ritas web application and place their order for a drink or drinks in advance.  Once ordered, the customer will get a confirmation that their order will be ready upon pickup with an order number. We at ‘Ritas hope this makes the experience more enjoyable than it has ever been. We’ve been around for five years and are always looking for ways to improve and evolve. We take pride in our work and strive to make not only our regulars satisfied, but all the new faces that step through the doors of ‘Ritas satisfied. Here’s to many more years!


🍹The ideas behind the web application.

I wanted to create an application that was clean and simple. When you visit our web application our goal is to make sure the buyer doesn't question what to do and how to do it. Self-explanatory was a keyword that kept getting mentioned throughout the building process. We want our peers to come back to our application. Not only will this application make the experience better for our consumers, but it will add more value to our profit. The more orders we get outside of ‘Rita's walls combined with the orders inside the bar will only build up more of our profit. If the application isn’t functional enough people will stop using the platform. This concludes why I wanted to make it as clean and simple as possible
